### Combinational Optimization

#### [Q408: Word chain having maximum length](https://codeiq.jp/ace/stakemura/q408)

* Code 1 : [word_chain.cpp](word_chain/word_chain.cpp)
  * C++11
  * Compiled on Visual Studio 2013 Preview (VC12)
* This program can find <=32 word chain within about 1 sec on modern PC.
* As for 33, the computation time will reach about 30 sec.
* However as for 34, the computation time will reach >100000 sec !!!
* Finally as for 35, you will realize the meaning of 'combinational explosion' :-)

* Code 2 : [word_chain_optimized.cpp](word_chain_optimized/word_chain_optimized.cpp)
  * Improved version
* This program can find 35(=Max) word chain within only about 3 sec on modern PC.
