#### [Q450: Shortest common superstring](https://codeiq.jp/ace/stakemura/q450)

* Code 1 : [shortest_superstring.py](shortest_superstring/shortest_superstring.py)
  * Implemented in Python 2.7
    * Depends on NetworkX and matplotlib
  * This program is now a supplemental code not the answer code.
  * Visualize the substring network or generate its file (See command line option).

#### [Q408: Longest word chain](https://codeiq.jp/ace/stakemura/q408)

* Code 1 : [word_chain.cpp](word_chain/word_chain.cpp)
  * Implemented in C++11
    * Compiled with Visual Studio 2013 RC (VC12)
  * This program can find <=32 word chain within about 1 second on modern PC.
  * As for 33, the execute time might be about 30 seconds.
  * However as for 34, the computation time will reach >100000 seconds !
  * Finally as for 35, you will realize the meaning of 'combinational explosion' :-)

* Code 2 : [word_chain_optimized.cpp](word_chain_optimized/word_chain_optimized.cpp)
  * Improved version
  * This program can find 35(=longest) word chain in only 1-3 seconds on modern PC.
